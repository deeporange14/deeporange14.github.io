            Welcome to the data portal for Deep Orange 14 (DO-14), a tracked, skid-steered autonomous research vehicle developed by Clemson University’s Deep Orange program in collaboration with the US Army’s DEVCOM Ground Vehicle System Center (GVSC). The DO-14 was designed as a high-speed, off-road platform for disaster relief, reconnaissance, and advanced data collection, tackling complex, multidisciplinary challenges in systems integration, autonomy, powertrain, control, and safety.
            This site provides a comprehensive dataset gathered from the DO-14's extensive testing and real-world applications, along with key design and development insights. Our goal is to support other researchers and engineers working in ground vehicle autonomy by offering data and documentation that highlights lessons learned, innovative solutions, and validation data.
            Explore the resources below to dive into the design details, dataset, and specifications of the DO-14, a powerful tool for validating and advancing control and autonomy in high-speed, off-road environments.
